[Demo](/experiments/music-for-10010-musicians/),
[Code](https://github.com/rlayte/rlayte.github.com/blob/master/experiments/music-for-10010-musicians/eno.js)

Another canvas experiment from a while ago, based on [this idea](http://lab.andre-michelle.com/pulsate) from [Andre Michelle](http://twitter.com/#!/andremichelle).

Click to create new circles, when they collide they reverse and play a sample based on their current diameter.
